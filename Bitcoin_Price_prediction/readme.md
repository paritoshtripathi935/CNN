# Context
Things like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are constantly coming in the news articles I read. So I wanted to understand more about it and this post helped me get started. Once the basics are done, the data scientist inside me started raising questions like:

1.How many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations?
2.Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days?

So what next?
Now that we have the price data, I wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. I started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to Blockchain Info, I was able to get quite a few parameters on once in two day basis.

This will help understand the other factors related to Bitcoin price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.

# Inspiration
Some of the questions which could be inferred from this dataset are:

How did the historical prices / market capitalizations of various currencies change over time?
Predicting the future price of the currencies
Which currencies are more volatile and which ones are more stable?
How does the price fluctuations of currencies correlate with each other?
Seasonal trend in the price fluctuations
